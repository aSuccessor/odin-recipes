This project will build a basic recipe website. It 
will not look pretty at first, but it will later 
be re-visited and improved upon later in the curriculum. 
Upon completion of this first, basic recipe website I should have 
sufficiently demonstrated the use of links, lists, and images 
along with their respective attributes.
